Hi all,

This is what I had in mind for tomorrow. Apparently there is going to be 3 coaches and 18 players joining tomorrow. Hopefully Nimenhuuto reflects what will happen tomorrow.

Let's split them into two groups (Ana) after warm-up. I can do the warm-up (jogging, berries, jumping, maybe relays)? So you can set up stations in the meanwhile.

Advanced group () will have two drills and a lot of playing. 
Drill A, 10 mins  https://www.fortumtutor.fi/materials/jalkapallo/treenivinkit/futisleikit/Potki%20kaverin%20pallo%20pois.pdf
Use variation (all with a ball), when players lose ball they return to the game to avoid waiting.
Break
Drill B, 10 mins

Goals are done by dribbling through the goal

Novice group () will have three drills and some playing.
