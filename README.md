## 4: Developing Young Players
Learning is optimal when the demands of the session matches their intellectual, psychological and motor skills. Avoid too complex games and drills too soon. 

Player remembers only 19% of what she/he was instructed or told. This raises to 32% when explained and demonstrated. In the cases where she/he is able to generate the information (or discovery) on his own, but with the help of a teacher, memorisation raises to *65%!!*. That is why players should actively participate in the coaching and learning process. Learning happens when the coach is able to transfer decisions to players.
